# example models

parametric models and a design template ([also available in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol/blob/master/models/colab/design_template_colab.ipynb)) are provided to demonstrate the use of FullControl 

1. [fullcontrol.xyz](https://fullcontrol.xyz) models in a jupytner notebook format:
    - [nonplanar spacer](https://fullcontrol.xyz/#/models/971ff7)  - [open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol/blob/master/models/colab/nonplanar_spacer_colab.ipynb)

more designs are available on the fullcontrol [gists page](https://gist.github.com/fullcontrol-xyz)

the above links open the models in google colab, but they can also be downloaded and run on a local version of python with FullControl installed
